## Project Overview

This project presents the modeling and graphical resolution of several **Linear Programming (LP)** problems using:

- Mathematical modeling
- Graphical method (2 variables)
- Python (NumPy + Matplotlib)
- LaTeX report

The objective is to:

- Formulate real-world optimization problems as linear programs
- Determine feasible regions
- Identify optimal solutions graphically
- Validate results mathematically

---

## Problems Covered

This homework includes **6 optimization problems**:

1. Agriculture resource allocation  
2. Medicine formulation problem  
3. Production planning problem  
4. Media selection problem (modeling only – more than 2 variables)  
5. Linear Program – Maximization  
6. Linear Program – Maximization  

Each problem includes:

- Decision variables
- Constraints
- Objective function
- Graphical representation (when possible)
- Optimal solution

## LaTeX Report

The complete mathematical formulation and detailed solutions are available in:

- `main.tex`
- `Homework_01.pdf`

The report includes:

- Formal LP formulation
- Definition of decision variables
- Explicit constraints and objective functions
- Graphical analysis
- Mathematical justification of optimal solutions

---

## Python Implementation

All graphical solutions were generated using:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

Each script:

1. Defines the constraint equations
2. Plots constraint lines
3. Shades the feasible region
4. Highlights the optimal solution
